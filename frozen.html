    <p><h3><i>The movie begins with a crew of ice harvesters collecting ice from a frozen lake in the Scandinavian mountains ("Frozen Heart"). <br>Among them is an 8-year-old orphan boy named Kristoff, and his reindeer calf friend Sven, who try to emulate the harvesters but are always shut out.<br> After collecting enough ice, the harvesters load it onto their sled and depart, headed for the town of Arendelle.<br><br>
        The scene changes to a castle in the kingdom of Arendelle. <br>That night, 5-year-old Princess Anna is restless, so she tries to wake up her 8-year-old sister Elsa to play.<br><br> Elsa playfully brushes her sister off until Anna mischievously asks..... "Do you want to build a snowman?",to which Elsa delightedly agrees.<br><br><br>The sisters run down to the ballroom and create a winter field of snow using Elsa's snow magic, enjoying their time with plenty of merriment.<br><br> They build a snowman, who Elsa names OLAF, claiming "I like warm hugs!"<br>

        <center><img src="https://i.gifer.com/SjUP.gif" alt=""height="25%" width="50%"></center> <br>The girls play gleefully with Olaf until Anna makes a leap as Elsa slips on the ice and the blast of power meant to create a pile of snow accidentally hits Anna in the head, knocking her unconscious and turning a streak of her hair platinum blonde.<br><br> Their parents, King Agnarr and Queen Iduna rush in, responding to Elsa's cries of anguish. They check on Anna and she is cold to the touch.<br> Agnarr and Iduna hastily load their daughters onto their horses and ride at full speed into the mountains.<br><br>As the royal family gallop their horses through the forests at full speed, they pass by Kristoff, who is still being dragged on his sled by Sven.<br><br> He is intrigued by the trail of ice Elsa left behind by one of the horses, and follows it into an empty clearing that appears to only be populated by a large assortment of moss-covered boulders.<br><br> From the edge of the clearing, Kristoff watches the royal family appear to ask the boulders for help.<img align="left"src="https://freepngimg.com/save/133907-frozen-anna-download-hd/634x638"alt=""height="25%" width="25%">Suddenly, the boulders all begin to roll into a circle around the royal family, then unfold themselves, revealing themselves to be the trolls.<br><br> In fact, the "boulder" that Kristoff is hiding behind is revealed to be another troll, Bulda,<br><br> who takes Kristoff and Sven in after seeing they are cute (and in part because Sven licks her).<br><br>Pabbie,the leader of the trolls, shows up and asks whether Elsa was born or cursed with her abilities.<br><br> After being told she was born with it, Pabbie examines Anna and remarks that it is fortunate that she was hit in the head, as a hit to the heart would have been fatal.<br><br> He advises the family that it might be best to not have Elsa use her powers around Anna, and alters Anna's memories, so she has no knowledge of her sister's powers to be safe, remembering only the fun they've had.<br><br> Pabbie warns Elsa that her powers will grow, and although they are beautiful, they'll be dangerous if she cannot learn to control them, as fear will be her greatest enemy.<br><br>Subsequently, the castle is closed off to visitors. Staffing is reduced to a minimum, and Elsa is ostracized from everyone, including Anna, in order to protect her from the world until she can learn to control her powers, leaving both sisters distraught and lonely.<br><br> Despite Anna's best attempts ("Do You Want to Build a Snowman?"), she is unable to rouse Elsa from her room.<br><br> Their despair only escalates ten years after the accident, when their parents depart on a diplomatic mission for two weeks, Agnarr and Iduna are killed when the ship they are on capsizes in a storm and is swallowed by a huge monstrous wave.<br><br> Anna goes again to Elsa's door, pleading for consolation from her only remaining family member.<br><br> However, although Elsa sits sadly on the other side of the door, she refuses to communicate with Anna.<br><br>Three years later, Elsa is about to be coronated as the Queen of Arendelle. Dignitaries from around Europe are coming to visit, including the Duke of Weselton, who wants to run Arendelle's profits dry.<br><br> Nobody is more excited than Anna, as they are finally opening the gates to the kingdom.<br><br> She is happy to see other people, and hopes for the possibility of meeting that special someone, but Elsa is still concerned about trying to control her powers and hide them from everyone ..........<br><br>("For the First Time in Forever").At the coronation reception, one of the servants introduces Elsa and Anna to the crowd.<br><br> Anna's first friendly interaction with Elsa in years brings quite a delightful feeling to the princess, flustered at first, and seeing Elsa so happy instead of serious and reserved boosts Anna's confidence, prompting her to continue on with the conversation.<br><br> They're interrupted afterward by their steward Kai introducing the Duke of Weselton who offers Elsa her first dance as queen.<br><br> Elsa politely declines the offer, but instead playfully volunteers Anna, much to the Duke's delight nonetheless, and the two head off into a comical dance scene. Elsa can't resist chuckling seeing Anna get innocently flustered by the Duke's over-the-top (and incredibly terrible) dancing skills.<br><br> This causes Anna to feel just as whimsical about the entire matter, for seeing Elsa in such a state is a sight.<br><br> Anna returns by Elsa's side afterward, commenting on how well things have been going through the day, and expresses her wishes to have things the way they were that night all the time.<br><br> Elsa does agree though her smile, unfortunately, fades away, and she reluctantly denies Anna's wishes all at once despite failing to explain why.<img align="right"src="https://www.pngkey.com/png/full/284-2843598_get-more-png-images-of-frozen-characters-hans.png" alt="" height="20%"width="20%">
        As Anna strolls out onto the streets, she accidentally crashes into a horse belonging to a charming and handsome visitor, and falls into a rowboat. The visitor apologizes, and introduces himself as Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.<br><br> Though angered at first by the clumsiness of the stranger, Anna is attracted by Hans' appearance once she lays her eyes on him.<br><br> She hurries off when she hears the church bells.Elsa remains nervous during the coronation ceremony.<br><br> The bishop reminds her to take off her gloves before she takes up her golden orb and scepter. Holding them, she turns to face the congregation, but almost immediately, she sees the gold on the orb start to frost over.<br><br> She returns the orb and scepter hurriedly to the bishop and puts her gloves back on, narrowly averting disaster.<br><br><br>Anna and Hans then sneak off to spend the evening together, quickly realizing the mutual attraction between them.<br><br> The romantic dance eventually leads to an entire date ("Love is an Open Door"), with the entire night of the young couple being spent bonding.<br><br>Hans, during their time together, learns of Anna's longing of having someone special in her life, with her sister, apparently developing a dislike of being around her by suddenly shutting Anna out one day when they were kids.<br><br> Hans openly relates to this, only furthering Anna's connection with him.  Hans proposes to Anna right on the spot which she immediately accepts.<br><br> The two head back to the ballroom, where Anna asks for Elsa's blessing on the marriage.<br><br> Elsa ceases the sudden rambling by denying the marriage, much to Anna's dismay.<br><br> She asks to speak to Anna alone in private, likely so she can explain why it's not wise to marry someone she just met without causing a scene that would surely get her magical nature exposed, but Anna refuses any private conversation.<br><br>Elsa, becoming impatient and frustrated, outright forbids Anna of marrying someone she just met, indirectly telling Anna she knows nothing about true love.<br><br>Anna orders the guards to end the party early and close the gates.<br><br>Unable to contain her emotions, Elsa makes a violent swipe with her arm, causing a barrier of sharp icicles to appear, nearly striking the guests and Anna.<br><br> Shocked at her unexpected outburst and the way everyone responded, Elsa rushes from the room.<img align="left"src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d7eefcc0848b57c2a655d29da8d0adc8/tumblr_n3sp86bX3G1t08swio1_1280.png"alt=""height="20%"width="20%">Panicking, Elsa flees with Anna in hot pursuit.<br><br> When a woman asks Elsa if she's all right, she is frightened enough that she accidentally backs into and freezes an ornamental fountain.<br><br> She keeps running away, sprinting across the waters of the fjord, her feet freezing the water, and vanishes into the woods on the other side of the fjord.<br><br> Anna calls after Elsa.Moments later, snow begins to fall.<br><br> The Duke begins to panic, declaring they must take action and put an end to Elsa's curse.Anna, however, refuses and volunteers to seek out Elsa herself and make things right.<br><br>With Hans being left in charge of the kingdom, Anna heads off on her horse to begin her search for her sister.<br><br><br><br>

        <img align="right"src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BouncyDismalHind-size_restricted.gif" alt=""height="30%" width="35%">
        Meanwhile, Elsa has found her way to a high precipice on the kingdom's North Mountain.<br><br>Being on her own,<br> she can begin to control her powers.<br> She constructs an elaborate ice palace,<br> changes her confining wardrobe into a shimmering ice dress,<br> and vows to stay in seclusion,<br> where she feels she can be herself,<br> and harm no one else.<br><br>The next morning, Anna is seen traveling slowly through knee-deep snow on horseback. Anna loses her horse. She travels on foot until nightfall.<br><br> Just then, Anna slips and falls into an ice-cold creek, which freezes her dress stiff. She staggers the rest of the way to the cabin with the chimney,a place run by its burly owner, Oaken.<br><br>Anna quickly staggers into Oaken's store.<br>Anna inquires if Elsa has visited recently. As if on cue, an adult Kristoff staggers in out of the storm, covered head to foot in snow, seeking to buy a rope, an axe, and carrots for Sven.<br><br>Kristoff argues with Oaken over the drastic increase in the prices of the items he needs, which ends with Oaken roughly throwing Kristoff out into the snow.<br><br>

         He is soon met by Anna, who has his supplies for him, on condition he takes her up the North Mountain immediately. Kristoff reluctantly agrees.<br><br>
         As the discussion turns to Elsa, Anna explains to Kristoff what made Elsa go ice dreaded. However, the conversation is interrupted when the sled is ambushed by a pack of ravenous wolves.<br><br>Anna manages to take out a few of the wolves by herself.<br><br>Kristoff hurriedly throws Anna onto Sven's back, then, just as they reach the cliff, he uses his knife to cut Sven's harness.<br><br> Anna and Sven successfully clear the chasm, and Kristoff does, just barely.<br><br> He decides to help Anna keep going, worried about her safety.<br><br>Early the next morning, Anna and Kristoff enter a frosted-over glen. They suddenly hear a new voice, a little snowman named Olaf.<br><br>He then introduces himself and says he likes warm hugs. Anna is immediately reminded of the snowman she and Elsa built as kids and realized that Elsa had created him.<br><br> Anna and Kristoff tell Olaf that they want to find Elsa to bring back summer.Follow him as he leads them to Elsa's ice palace.<br><br><br>

         
         
         Later, Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf arrive at Elsa's ice palace.<br><br>Meanwhile, when they get to the front door, Anna tells Kristoff and Olaf to wait outside, warning them that the last time she introduced Elsa to a guy, she froze everything.<br><br>Inside, Anna is stunned at the glorious interior of the palace.Though Elsa is happy to see Anna and quickly forgives her for the argument that happened at the coronation party, she becomes nervous and suggests Anna leave, so she can't harm her.<br><br>She demands Anna to leave.However, Anna's promising to stand by her sister's side and help her, Elsa only grows more agitated and nervous, resulting in her magic flaring.<br><br>This time, a blast of magic bursts out and strikes Anna in the heart.<img align="left"src="https://pngimg.com/d/frozen_PNG7.png" alt=""height="25%" width="25%"> In desperation to get her sister to safety, Elsa creates a giant snow creature to throw them out. Anna balls up a snowball and throws it at the snow beast.<br><br> Though it left literally no damage whatsoever, the lack of respect was enough to infuriate Marshmallow and cause him to chase Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf down the North Mountain while Sven runs off into a different direction, which leads to the bottom of a cliff, and most likely eliminate them.<br><br>Marshmallow continues his chase for Anna and Kristoff. He pulls them up to him by the rope, and yells at them "Don't Come Back!".<br><br> Anna then grabs Kristoff's knife and cuts the rope.<br><br> This sends the duo falling down, though they survive. With his mission to drive them away complete, Marshmallow returns to the ice palace.<br><br>
         Kristoff notices that Anna's hair has started to turn white. Fearful that she may be injured, Kristoff takes her to his family... who happen to be a group of rock trolls ― the same ones that saved Anna many years before.<br><br>Anna collapses before the two can be wed by Gothi the Troll Priest, and Pabbie appears and examines Anna, but concludes that this time her sister's powers struck her in the heart.<br><br> Pabbie cannot save her; Anna's heart has begun to freeze and if not cured, she will become frozen as ice forever. Pabbie says <br><br>"AN ACT OF TRUE LOVE CAN MELT A FROZEN HEART"<br><br> Anna quickly tells Kristoff that Hans can surely help, and they take off for Arendelle.<br><br>The next morning, Hans' party arrives at Elsa's ice castle. Shortly after they arrive, Hans orders that no harm is to come to Elsa.<br><br>The moment they come close enough, Marshmallow reveals himself from the form of snow boulders. The archer immediately attacks the beast with their arrows.Marshmallow is able to hold most of the guards off.<br><br> Hans,eventually using his sword to slice the snow monster's leg off and cause him to lose balance.With Marshmallow wounded, Hans begins heading inside Elsa's castle.<br><br>They corner Elsa. Despite her pleading for them to leave her alone, they shoot at her. She quickly forms walls of ice to block their shots.<br><br> Hans and his men show up just in time, and Hans pleads for her to stop so she doesn't become the monster people accuse her of being. <br><br>Elsa settles down a bit at Hans' words, realizing the demon she is becoming, and halts her magic. Elsa tries to run, but the falling chandelier fragments hit her and knock her unconscious.<br><br>

When Elsa wakes up, she's in a dungeon cell at Arendelle with her hands chained and encased in steel mitts.<br><br> As she looks out over the frozen kingdom and realizes what she has done, Hans appears, telling Elsa that Anna has not returned. <br><br>Unknowingly of what happened to Elsa, Anna, Kristoff, and Sven arrive at the castle.<br><br> Anna's condition has grown worse, a chill coursing through her, and more of her hair has turned white.Anna is brought to Hans and tells him that he has to kiss her to save her.<br><br> <img align="right"src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/17/Anna-Frozen-PNG-File.png" alt=""height="30%" width="30%">          The castle staff in the room quickly leave to give them privacy. Hans places Anna in a chair, leans in as if to kiss her, and then his smile turns into a smear, and he says, "Oh, Anna... if only there was someone out there who loved you."<br><br> As Anna looks at him in shocked confusion, Hans explains that he went looking for a royal family he could marry into.<br><br>However, with Anna becoming weaker and about to die, he plans to simply let her frozen heart overcome her, then kill Elsa, ending the eternal winter and bringing back summer. Anna, now hating Hans for his cruelty.<br><br>He extinguishes the fire in the nearby fireplace before locking her in the room. Anna collapses with shock, her hair now completely white.<br><br>Hans goes to speak with the Duke of Weselton and several other dignitaries. He feigns grief and claims that Elsa has killed Anna,this apparently is enough to give him full authority to declare Elsa guilty and sentence her to death.<br><br>
Elsa freezes her shackles to the point that they shatter and then breaks through the wall to the outside.<br><br>

Meanwhile,far from Arendelle, Kristoff and Sven walk away when Sven urges Kristoff to go back and confess his feelings for her.<br><br> Kristoff claims he has no need to, but as they look back at Arendelle, a mysterious swirling cloud of snow begins to engulf the kingdom. The two then take off towards the growing danger.<br><br>Anna's curse becomes stronger with her death process nearly complete. When Olaf arrives, he finds Anna in the library on the ground and quickly dying. Olaf comes to Anna's rescue and starts a fire to warm Anna up.Anna brokenheartedly admits to Olaf that she doesn't even know what love is.<br><br> Olaf replies by telling Anna that love is putting someone else before yourself, using Kristoff as an example. This reveals Kristoff's true feelings to Anna.<br><br>Olaf notices Kristoff and Sven rushing across the fjord to the castle. Knowing Kristoff is truly the one that loves Anna, the two try to head out to meet him.<br><br>

Olaf helps Anna up, but the storm outside is so worse. Going out a window, the two slide down the castle's steep roofs. <br><br>Anna attempts to make her way across the icy fjord, with Olaf close behind. However, as the wind picks up, Olaf is blown away, and Anna finds her hands are turning to ice. Even so, she continues to move forward, calling out Kristoff's name.<br><br>Meanwhile, Hans finds Elsa wandering the ice of the fjord. Hans lies and says that Anna was killed by Elsa's magic.<br><br> The pain of this causes Elsa to collapse, the snow in the air suddenly hanging in stillness. This then gives Kristoff and Anna the chance to reach each<br> other. But at that moment, Anna hears a sword being drawn a short distance away.<br><br> In horror, Anna sees Hans about to swing his sword at Elsa and slice her head off.<br><br> With seconds to choose between saving her own life or Elsa's life, Anna takes one last look at Kristoff and runs towards Elsa.<img align="left"src="https://c-fa.cdn.smule.com/rs-s34/arr/f6/87/c73330aa-caa6-4bf3-ad5f-98cd1ea2ada7_1024.jpg"alt=""height="20%"width="20%"> <br><br>Just as Hans is taking his swing at Elsa, Anna steps in front of him and freezes solid.<br><br>Hans's sword makes contact with Anna's frozen form, shattering and breaking it, and a sudden shock wave throws him brutally backward and knocks him unconscious.<br><br>Kristoff and Sven arrive seconds later. Seeing Anna turned frozen solid, Elsa breaks down in tears, hugging her sister.<br><br> No one is sure what to say when Anna's icy form begins to change and gain color. Soon enough suddenly melts back to normal because her sacrifice to save Elsa is considered an act of true love.<br><br>Elsa realizes that love is the key to control her powers.<br><br>When Hans awakens several moments later, he finds Arendelle thawed and peace restored. <br><br>Kristoff tries to march forward towards Hans to attack him, and Elsa seems touched by Kristoff's protectiveness over her and Anna.She and Elsa hug, with their friendship restored than ever.<br><br> As the sisters hug, Anna looks lovingly towards Kristoff, showing that she reciprocates his love.<br><br>

Once again, Arendelle is restored to normal. Elsa is once again accepted as queen, with everyone finally understanding that she is a creator of beautiful magic.<br><br> Exposed as the manipulating lying traitor he is, Hans is arrested and deported back to his own kingdom to face punishment.<br><br><img align="right" src="https://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/38500000/Anna-and-Kristoff-frozen-38561158-1200-834.png" alt=""height="20%" width="20%">
Elsewhere, Anna leads a blindfolded Kristoff to the docks,gives Kristoff a new sled, and reveals that Elsa has named him the Official Ice Master for the kingdom and so he can be with Anna.<br><br> He attempts to decline both the sled and the title.<br><br>When she asks what his thoughts on the sled are, Kristoff picks up Anna and twirls her around in his arms, exclaiming he loves it and that he could kiss her.<br><br> Realizing what he said, Kristoff immediately puts her down and stammers awkwardly that he'd like to, among several sentences of nonsense, leaving him embarrassingly flustered.<br><br> Anna kisses his cheek, saying to Kristoff, "We may," and the two share their first kiss, officially beginning their romantic relationship.<br><br>Elsa creates an ice rink in one of the castle courtyards and promises to never shut the castle gates ever again, and Elsa and Anna both knew that nothing would ever come between them again as well.<br><br> Elsa gifts Anna a pair of ice skates made out of snow and ice. Anna is delighted but tells Elsa that she can't skate. Elsa delightfully and playfully helps her, and she is later joined by Olaf.<br><br> The film ends with everyone in the village happily skating in Elsa's ice rink.<br><br>
