    <p><h3><i>On the Polynesian island of Motunui, the inhabitants worshipped the goddess of nature, Te Fiti <br><br>a living island who brought life to the ocean long ago using a pounamu stone as her heart and the source of her power).<br><br> Maui, the trickster, shape-shifting demigod of the wind and sea and master of wayfinding, stole the heart to give humanity the power of creation.<br><br> This caused Te Fiti to disintegrate, and Maui was attacked by Te Kā, a volcanic demon.<br><br>

    That afternoon, Moana's grandmother Tala shows her a secret cavern of ships, revealing that their people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it.<br><br> Tala explains that Te Kā's darkness is poisoning the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and has him restore the heart of Te Fiti.<br><br> Having been given the heart by the ocean, Tala gives it to Moana.<br><br> Tala later falls ill and, on her deathbed, tells Moana that she must depart to find Maui.<br><br>
