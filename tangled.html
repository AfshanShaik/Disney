<p><h3><i>Long ago, a drop of magical sunlight falls from the sky and sprouts a flower with healing powers. <br><br>
    However, an old woman, named Mother Gothel, hides the flower and uses it to stay young for centuries.<br><br>
     The soldiers from the nearby kingdom of Corona then take it to save their pregnant and ill Queen, who gives birth to a daughter with golden hair.<br><br>
      One night, Gothel sneaks into the castle, and discovers that while her hair shares the healing flower's magic, it turns brown and becomes powerless when cut.<br><br>
       She kidnaps the girl, named Rapunzel, and raises her in a hidden tower in the woods, using her hair to stay young.<br><br>

       Each year on their daughter's birthday, the king and queen release sky lanterns in hope they will guide her home.<br><br>
        Rapunzel is fascinated by the annual lights, and, on the eve of her 18th birthday, asks for permission to attend the release as a birthday gift.<br><br>
         Gothel refuses, saying the outside world is too dangerous for her.<br><br>
          Later, handsome thief Flynn Rider steals Rapunzel's intended crown from the palace and abandons his partners the Stabbington brothers.<br><br>
           While being relentlessly pursued by a royal guardsman's horse named Maximus, he takes refuge in the tower.<br><br>
            Rapunzel knocks him out with a frying pan and hides him in a closet. However, when she attempts to show Gothel the thief as proof she is capable of leaving, Gothel angrily berates Rapunzel and again refuses to let her leave the tower.<br><br>
             Hatching a plan, Rapunzel sends Gothel on a three-day journey to get new paints as a substitute gift.<br><br>

Rapunzel hides the crown and tells Flynn he can only get it back by taking her to see the lights. He agrees, and the two set off.<br><br> Along the way, they stop at the Snuggly Duckling pub, where menacing thugs try to capture the wanted Flynn, but Rapunzel charms them into revealing their softer sides.<br><br> When royal guards arrive, the thugs help her and Flynn escape.<br><br> Meanwhile, Gothel becomes suspicious, returns to the now empty tower, and finds the crown.<br><br> She sets out to find Rapunzel and allies with the Stabbington brothers.<br><br>
Flynn and Rapunzel become trapped in a fast-flooding cave. Believing they will die, Flynn reveals his true name, Eugene Fitzherbert, and Rapunzel reveals her magic powers.<br><br> Her glowing hair shows a hidden exit, and they escape and hide in the woods.<br><br> That night, Gothel catches up to Rapunzel while Eugene is away, gives her the crown, and tells her to test Eugene's loyalty.<br><br>
The next morning, Maximus tracks down Eugene.<br> Rapunzel demands a birthday truce, and Maximus reluctantly agrees, joining them as they enter the kingdom and attend a festival in honor of the "lost princess".<br><br> After a day of celebration, they sail onto the lake to watch the release of the lanterns.<br><br> Having fulfilled her dream, Rapunzel gives Eugene the crown, and they confess their love.<br><br><br>

When Eugene sees the Stabbington brothers on the shore, he goes to apologize and offers them the crown, but they abduct him, tying him to a ship with the crown so the royal guards will arrest him and Rapunzel will think he abandoned her.<br><br> They try to capture Rapunzel, but Gothel stages a "rescue" and urges Rapunzel back to the tower.<br><br> Heartbroken and feeling betrayed, Rapunzel agrees to go.<br><br>
Eugene escapes with the help of Maximus and the pub thugs. Meanwhile, Rapunzel realizes she has subconsciously incorporated the kingdom's standard, a golden sun, into her artwork all her life.<br><br> Finally understanding that she is the "lost princess!!!".<br><br> She confronts Gothel.<br><br><img align="right"src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6e/3f/eb/6e3feb2f8f84a30e010355c85ead453e.gif" alt=""height="25%"width="25%"> Eugene arrives at the tower and calls to Rapunzel. Her hair is lowered to him, but upon climbing up he finds her bound and gagged, and Gothel fatally stabs him from behind.<br><br>
She tries to drag Rapunzel to a new hiding place.<br><br> Rapunzel first vows to fight her, then offers to go willingly if Gothel will allow her to heal Eugene.<br><br> Gothel reluctantly agrees, but Eugene, realizing Rapunzel would spend the rest of her life in captivity, cuts off her hair before she can heal him.  <br><br>
Gothel begins to age rapidly and turns to dust as she falls from the tower.<br><br><br>

Rapunzel mourns her lost love, and one of her tears, still having some of the sun's power, brings him back to life.<br><br> Eugene reunites Rapunzel with her royal parents, is fully pardoned for his crimes, and he and Rapunzel are married as the kingdom celebrates.<br><br>
