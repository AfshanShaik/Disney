    <p><h3><i>A peddler shows the viewers an oil lamp amongst his wares, and begins to tell the story of the lamp.
        <br><br><br>Jafar, a ruthless sorcerer and the royal vizier of the Middle Eastern city of Agrabah, seeks a lamp hidden within the Cave of Wonders.<br><br> The cave's guardian tells him that only one person is worthy to enter: "the diamond in the rough",<br><br> whom Jafar later identifies as a young street urchin named Aladdin.<br><br> Meanwhile, Princess Jasmine is upset by her obligation to marry a prince due to the law rather than for love.<br><br>

        Concealing herself, she escapes the palace and is saved from an angry merchant by Aladdin and his pet monkey Abu.<br><br> As a bond between Aladdin and Jasmine develops, the palace guards capture Aladdin on Jafar's orders, during which Jasmine reveals herself.<br><br> She confronts Jafar to demand Aladdin's release, but he lies to her, saying Aladdin has been executed.<br><br>
        Disguised as an elderly beggar, Jafar frees Aladdin and Abu and brings them to the cave, ordering them to retrieve the lamp.<br><br>
        The guardian grants Aladdin entry, but warns him to touch nothing but the lamp.<br><br>

        Aladdin finds both the lamp and a magic carpet inside, but Abu greedily grabs a large jewel, triggering the cave's collapse.<br><br> Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar, who throws him and Abu into the collapsing cave, though not before Abu steals it back.<br><br> Trapped, Aladdin rubs the lamp and meets the genie who lives inside it.<br><br> The Genie grants Aladdin three wishes, though Aladdin tricks him into freeing them all from the cave without using a wish.<br><br> Upon learning that the Genie desires to be released from servitude, Aladdin promises to use his last wish to free him.<br><br> Aladdin uses his first wish to become a prince, intending to woo Jasmine.<br><br>
        Jafar's parrot minion Iago suggests to his master that he can become Sultan by marrying Jasmine.<br><br> Aladdin, as "Prince Ali Ababwa," arrives in Agrabah with a large host, but Jasmine is angered when her father, the Sultan, discusses her marriage with only Aladdin and Jafar.<br><br>
        As a means of apologizing, Aladdin takes Jasmine on a ride with the magic carpet.<br>

     When she infers his true identity, he claims that he only dresses as a commoner to escape the stresses of royal life. After Aladdin brings Jasmine home, the palace guards capture him on Jafar's behest and throw him into the sea.<br><br> The Genie appears and saves Aladdin at the cost of his second wish.<br><br> Aladdin returns to the palace and exposes Jafar's plot, prompting the latter to flee, but not before he glimpses the lamp and determines Aladdin's true identity.<br><br>

     Fearing that he will lose Jasmine if the truth is revealed, Aladdin breaks his promise and refuses to free the Genie.<br><br> Iago steals the lamp, and Jafar becomes the Genie's new master.<br><br> He uses his first two wishes to become both Sultan and the world's most powerful sorcerer.<br><br> He then exposes Aladdin, exiling him, Abu, and the carpet to a frozen wasteland.<br><br> The three escape and return to Agrabah, where Jasmine tries to help Aladdin steal the lamp back. Jafar notices and overpowers her, Abu, and the carpet with his magic.<br><br>
     Aladdin taunts Jafar for being less powerful than the Genie, tricking him into using his last wish to become an all-powerful genie himself.<br><br> Now bound to his new lamp, Jafar ends up trapped inside it, taking Iago with him.<br><br> The Genie then throws Jafar's lamp far into the desert, banishing Jafar and Iago to the Cave of Wonders for 10,000 years.<br><br>
     <br><br>With Agrabah returned to normal, the Genie encourages Aladdin to use his third wish to regain his royal title and legally marry Jasmine.<br><br> Aladdin instead decides to keep his promise and frees the Genie. Realizing Aladdin's nobility, the Sultan changes the law to allow Jasmine to marry whoever she chooses.<br><br> The Genie bids the group a fond farewell and leaves to explore the world, while Aladdin and Jasmine start their new life together.<br><br>
